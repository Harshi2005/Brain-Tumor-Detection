Proposed System / Solution

The proposed system focuses on detecting brain tumors using a deep learning-based image classification approach. It involves:
A pre-trained EfficientNetB3 model, fine-tuned on MRI scans for binary classification (Tumor / No Tumor)
Transfer learning to leverage learned features from large-scale datasets and adapt them to medical imaging.
A pipeline including image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, and evaluation for robust performance.
The model processes 224Ã—224 MRI images efficiently and achieves over 90% accuracy, making it suitable for real-time medical screening and diagnostic support.
